# Pnemonia_detection_using_xray_images
The healthcare sector has observed notable progressions as a result of incorporating computer technology and artificial intelligence (AI). 
This study explores the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques to the detection and management of pneumonia, a common respiratory disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. 
Pneumonia poses a significant hurdle in medical environments due to its diverse symptoms and the necessity for accurate diagnosis to ensure effective therapy. 
This study uses artificial intelligence (AI), namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), VGG16, ResNet50v2, and the most recent YOLOv8 algorithm, to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia recognition from chest X-ray images. Our dataset, obtained from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, comprises 5,866 X-ray images, 
meticulously scrutinized and annotated to uphold data integrity. The investigation offers a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of various AI models in categorizing pneumonia as opposed to normal instances. 
The YOLOv8 model emerged as the leading performer, attaining an impressive accuracy rate of 97.4\%, demonstrating its potential for instantaneous, high-accuracy diagnostic utilities. 
The results emphasize the transformative influence of AI in clinical decision support systems (CDSS), streamlining prompt and precise diagnoses that can substantially enhance patient outcomes. 
This manuscript aims to provide perspectives on the implementation of advanced AI models in healthcare, accentuating their capacity to revolutionize pneumonia diagnosis and therapy
